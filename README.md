# Overview

Welcome to the "space-invaders" project, a modern take on the classic arcade game. This project is a web-based game that utilizes HTML and JavaScript to create an interactive gaming experience. The game is initiated from an HTML file, which sets the visual properties of the webpage and imports the necessary JavaScript module. The JavaScript file defines the game's functionality, including starting the game, handling user input, updating game objects, and rendering graphics on the canvas.

# Technologies and Frameworks

This project is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the webpage and initiating the game.
- **JavaScript**: Used for defining the game's functionality and interactivity.
- **Node.js**: Used as the runtime environment for executing the JavaScript code.
- **npm**: Used as the package manager for managing the project's dependencies.
- **Webpack**: Used for bundling the JavaScript files.
- **Babel**: Used for transpiling the JavaScript code to ensure compatibility across different browsers.
